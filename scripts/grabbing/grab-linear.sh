# Linear grab: carry a block from (fromx, fromy) to (tox, toy).
#
# Coordinates are mm relative to the base point (restore + set-base). Every
# move is a straight move-to in one --sequence on a single connection: hover
# over the source at MID_Z, drop onto the block, grip, lift back to MID_Z,
# travel horizontally at MID_Z, drop to seat it, release, lift away. No servo
# arc, so the motion is deterministic point-to-point straight lines; the
# block clears the table while traveling at MID_Z.

# Usage: grab-linear.sh fromx fromy tox toy
